        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
           At FilmDiary, our mission is to create the ultimate movie database, providing comprehensive listings of every movie ever made from every corner of the globe. We aim to be the go-to resource for movie enthusiasts, researchers, and casual viewers alike, offering detailed information, historical context, and up-to-date listings.   
        </p>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        The idea for FilmDiary was born out of a simple frustration: the lack of a single, reliable source for complete movie listings. Existing platforms were often incomplete or region-specific. We decided to create an app that fills this gap, providing an inclusive, accurate, and user-friendly movie database.
